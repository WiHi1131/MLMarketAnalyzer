***Week 2***

**What did you do last week?**
* Created project proposal
* Set up website on github
* Researched market analysis domain, what kind of insights businesses might look for in a market analyzer tool, the data those insights might come from, and where to find that data
* Preemptively decided on a plan going forward, that this tool will conduct sentiment analysis on Twitter post data to find market gaps where needs are not being fulfilled by current products or services, organized by industry, with the goal of being able to identify potential profitable areas for entrepreneurs to find new market niches in. 
**What do you plan to do this week?**
* Find out how to access Twitter data and understand how its API works for subsequent analysis
**Are there any impediments in your way?**
* I'm not very familiar with APIs.
* Twitter data may not be as useful to me as I hope
* I do not know exactly where to start looking and how to get the data I need. 
**Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?**
* Last week I was in brainstorming mode, without very specific plans. This week, I would like to start making concrete actionable plans for exactly what needs to happen for this project. I think this should happen naturally as I dive into more specific problems and have to come up with solutions.
