# MLMarketAnalyzer.github.io
MLMarketAnalyzer is a ML-driven tool designed to provide valuable market analysis and insights. This project uses machine learning algorithms to process market data and predict trends, offering a strategic advantage in business decision-making.

**1\. Vision Statement**

This project will serve as a stepping stone in my journey towards becoming a proficient machine learning engineer. Through the process of designing, implementing, and deploying a market analysis tool, I aim to gain a deep understanding of data processing, machine learning model creation, and how to apply machine learning solutions to real-world business problems. This project will enhance my professional skills in machine learning, data analysis, programming, and problem-solving, and it will deepen my knowledge of the business market analysis domain.

**2\. Motivation**

As an aspiring machine learning engineer with entrepreneurial interests, I believe that building a machine learning-powered market analysis tool will not only sharpen my technical skills but also provide insights into how businesses operate and make strategic decisions. This project might also allow me to create a tangible product that could serve as the foundation for a future business venture. The opportunity to combine my passion for technology and entrepreneurship in a project that can provide real-world business solutions is a significant motivation for me.

**3\. Specific and Measurable Goals**

Given the time constraint of 45 hours over a 16-week semester, the project will be scoped as follows:

*   Weeks 1-2: Understand the domain: Spend the first 5 hours on understanding the market analysis domain, including different types of data used and the kind of insights businesses look for. Set up Github page per course instructions. 
    
*   Weeks 3-6: Data gathering and preprocessing: Allocate the next 10 hours for data gathering, cleaning, and preprocessing. All data gathered and prepared by the end of Week 6. 
    
*   Weeks 7-9: Model development: Use 15 hours to develop, train, and test a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. Model finished by the end of Week 9. 
    
*   Weeks 10-12: Tool development: Spend the remaining 15 hours developing a simple interface or API for users to input data and get market analysis insights. Final product finished by end of Week 12. 
    

The success of this project will be determined by whether I can deliver a functional market analysis tool that uses machine learning to provide useful insights from data. 

**4\. Risks to Project Completion**

*   **Data availability and quality**: Finding high-quality, relevant data that is free and publicly available might be challenging.
*   **Complexity of machine learning models**: Since I am relatively new to machine learning, I might face challenges in building effective models. I am currently taking Machine Learning (CSPB 4622) in conjunction with this class, and I might have to do some learning as I go along. 
*   **Lack of Experience with Interface or API Development**: I have never created an interface or API, and I have not taken the Software Development course yet, so this will be a learning process for me. 
* **Time Management**: I am taking 2 other courses concurrently, so time management may be problematic. 

**5\. Mitigation Strategy**

*   **Data availability and quality**: If free public data is insufficient or of poor quality, I will consider using synthetic data or exploring data marketplaces that sell relevant datasets.
*   **Complexity of machine learning models**: I will focus on implementing simple and proven machine learning models rather than trying to build complex ones. I will also make use of online resources, textbooks, and consult with my course instructors to overcome technical challenges.
*   **Lack of Experience with Interface or API Development**: Start with online self-learning from resources like Coursera, Udemy, freeCodeCamp, and MDN. Utilize frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js for UI; Flask, Express.js for APIs) to simplify development. Learn from open-source projects and start small, gradually adding features. Seek help from professors, peers, and online communities when needed, and allocate ample time for this new skill acquisition and development process in the project schedule.

*   **Time management**: I will make a detailed project timeline at the beginning of the semester, and I will stick to it. Regular progress checks will be done to ensure I'm on track.

**6\. Project Assessments**

The project will be deemed successful if:

*   A machine learning model is developed that can extract insights from market data. I am not sure if this is an unrealistic goal or not, but I will preemptively aim for at least a 75% accuracy rate in predictions using a test dataset. 
*   A user interface or API is created that allows users to input data and get analysis results within a reasonable timeframe (within a minute for datasets of up to 10,000 rows). 
*   I can confidently explain the core concepts and steps involved in the machine learning pipeline, as demonstrated through the final project presentation. Furthermore, I should be able to explain how the selected market data impacts business decisions and identify at least three key insights derived from the analysis of the test dataset. I am able to demonstrate an improved understanding of machine learning, data processing, and market analysis concepts.
*   I have a prototype or proof of concept that could potentially be developed into a marketable product in the future. The feasibility of this will be confirmed by receiving positive feedback from at least two industry professionals or potential users, whom I will find through LinkedIn or other networking. 

The completion of the project and meeting these goals will be evaluated through regular check-ins, demonstration of the tool, and self-assessment of knowledge and skills gained.
